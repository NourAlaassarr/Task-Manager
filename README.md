# Task Manager Application

## Overview

The Task Manager application is a simple and effective tool for managing tasks. It allows users to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on tasks. Users can mark tasks as completed or incomplete, filter tasks by their status, and optionally manage their own tasks with user authentication (sign up and login).

The application is built using **Node.js**, **Express**, and **MongoDB**, following best practices for RESTful API development. It uses JWT for secure authentication and data validation with Joi.

## Features

- **Create a Task**: Add a new task with a description.
- **Read Tasks**: View a list of tasks, with the option to filter by status (completed/incomplete).
- **Update Tasks**: Mark tasks as completed or incomplete.
- **Delete Tasks**: Remove tasks from the list.
- **User Authentication** (Optional): Users can sign up, log in, and manage their own tasks.

## Tech Stack

- **Backend**: Node.js with Express
- **Database**: MongoDB
- **Authentication**: JWT (JSON Web Tokens)
- **Data Validation**: Joi

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/task-manager-app.git
```

### 2. Install dependencies:

```bash
cd task-manager-app

### 3. Set up your environment variables:

- Create a `.env` file in the root directory.
- Add your MongoDB connection URL and any other required variables (e.g., JWT secret).
  
Example `.env` file:

```env
MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/task-manager
JWT_SECRET=your_secret_key
```

### 4. Run the server:

```bash
